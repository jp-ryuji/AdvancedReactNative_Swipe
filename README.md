# Welcome

- The code in this repository is based on [React Native: Advanced Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-advanced/learn/v4/overview) on udemy.
  - The code was developed on Mac.
  - Checked the code worked on the iOS emulator.

- The original code resides [here](https://github.com/StephenGrider/AdvancedReactNative/tree/master/swipe). But there seem to be some old implementation.
